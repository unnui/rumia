## A Machine Learning visualization multitool
A multitool for developing machine learning, visually working with the algorithms and easily plotting the results, all while combining the powers of Rust and Julia. Stress-free, vacation-like AI playground!

### Barebones idea
No idea how this will work out, but at first hand it's just an experiment to learn more about these two languages and develop polyglot applications.

### Roadmap
1. Rust GUI with Tauri using Svelte
2. Add Julia bridge
3. ML functions
4. Visualization (unsure if pure Julia plots)
5. Create and save projects
6. ...
7. Oh, add a license too
